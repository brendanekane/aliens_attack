## Aliens Attack!

Aliens Attack! is a top down shooter inspired by Space Invaders and more
modern bullet hell shooters. I was always a fan of the simplistic game design
of Space Invaders but also enjoyed the chaotic nature of bullet hell games.

The welcome screen draws a brief introduction to the game on the canvas. The left sidebar contains information about the controls as well as buttons to start the game and to mute the music and sound effects. The right sidebar contains my short bio as well as clickable links to my relevant social media.

As soon as the Start button is pressed the game begins. The aliens will still move in their famous pattern but instead of firing occasionally, they begin with a hail of bullets.

Everything is destructible because of my custom made collision detection. Every bullet shot by an alien will reduce other objects health by one. The ship for example, will be destroyed after 5 hits. As long as the player still has lives left the ship will respawn.

The asteroid cover are also destructible, by both the aliens and the ship.

There are also several win conditions, however there are more lose conditions than there are win. The first lose condition is when you run out of lives.

The second lose condition is when the Aliens come in contact with your ship.

The third lose condition is when the Aliens reach the bottom.

The one and only win condition is when you destroy all of the attacking aliens.
